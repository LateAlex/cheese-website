    <h1>Cheese Rolling Race</h1>
    <p>
      The annual Cheese Rolling Race, formally known as the Copper’s Hill
      Cheese-Rolling and Wake, is an event held on the Spring Bank Holiday at
      Cooper’s Hill(link google map), near Gloucester, England. The rules are
      simple - chase the 4 kg of Double Gloucester cheese (link to our page)
      from the top of the hill and the first person to make it to the bottom and
      across the finishing line wins the cheese. In theory, the person who
      catches the cheese wins it, but due to the lightning speed of the cheese
      rolling down the hill which can take up to 110 km per hour, the chances of
      actually catching it are pretty slim! Until 2009, the Copper’s Hill
      Cheese-Rolling and Wake was an official event but due to safety concerns
      towards the spectators, the event was called off. This, however, hasn’t
      stopped the locals from continuing the tradition. The concerns are not
      without reason and contestants being hospitalized are not unheard of. As a
      matter of fact, Cooper’s Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake has been called the
      world’s most dangerous footrace. Despite the risks involved and the
      pressure from local council to address them, Cooper’s Hill Cheese-Rolling
      and Wake keeps coming back every year. As a safety precaution, the cheese
      was replaced by a foam replica in 2013. What started as a competition for
      the villagers of Brockworth has grown, and today people from all over the
      world participate in the cheese race.
